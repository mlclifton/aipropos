I want a TUI based utility invoked from the command line inside a terminal. When the utlity starts is presents a text box where the user types in a natural language explanation of what they want to do on the command line. The utility will call an LLM API and get back the specific commands to run. The prompt will specify that the AI is an expert in Linux development and will ensure that only the actual commands to be executed will be returned. The commands will be offered in a separate text box with an explanation in another separate text area. Hitting enter will copy the selected commands to the clipboard. The solution should be written in Python and use the Textual framework.
