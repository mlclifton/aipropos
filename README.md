# AI-Propos

**Caution:** This project is almost entirely generated by an AI assistant.

`aipropos` is a simple command-line tool that provides an LLM-enabled version of the classic Unix `apropos` command. Where `apropos` searches man page names and descriptions, `aipropos` uses a large language model to provide more natural language and conceptual search capabilities.

## Configuration

Before running `aipropos`, ensure that Ollama is installed and running. You can find installation instructions and more information on the [Ollama homepage](https://ollama.com/).

The connection to the Ollama API and the model used can be configured via environment variables. You can create a `.env` file in the root of the project to set these variables. An example is provided in `.env.example`.

-   `OLLAMA_API_BASE_URL`: The base URL for the Ollama API. Defaults to `http://localhost:11434`.
-   `OLLAMA_MODEL_NAME`: The name of the Ollama model to use. Defaults to `gemma3:4b`.

## Usage

To use `aipropos`, run the `main.py` script directly with your query as an argument:

```bash
./main.py "your search query here"
```

For example:

```bash
./main.py "how to list files"
```
